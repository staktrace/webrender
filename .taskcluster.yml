# This file specifies the configuration needed to test WebRender using the
# Taskcluster infrastructure. Most of this should be relatively self-explanatory;
# this file was originally generated by using the Taskcluster-GitHub integration
# quickstart tool at https://tools.taskcluster.net/quickstart/ and then expanded
# as needed.

# This file triggers a set of tasks; the ones targeting Linux are run in a docker
# container using docker-worker (which is a worker type provided by TaskCluster).
# The OS X ones are run in a custom worker type, for which we have worker
# instances configured and running.
tasks:
  # For the docker-worker tasks, the Docker image used
  # (staktrace/webrender-test:debian-v3) was created using the Dockerfile in
  # ci-scripts/docker-image.
  #
  # The docker image may need to be updated over time if the set of required
  # packages increases. Note in particular that rust/cargo are not part of the
  # docker image, and are re-installed using rustup on each CI run. This ensures
  # the latest stable rust compiler is always used.
  # CI runs will be triggered on opening PRs, updating PRs, and pushes to the
  # repository.
